# Business/Research Understanding Phase (Points: 4 - Speech Duration: 2 Minutes): 

1. **Define project requirements and objectives:**

> [!note] What are the primary objectives of this analysis in the X-Domain? How can data analytics improve decision-making processes?

- Analyze the relationship between social media usage patterns and various psychological factors.
- Identify trends, patterns, and insights to understand how social media impacts individuals' well-being and behavior.
- Use data analytics to improve decision-making processes related to social media usage and psychological health.

2. **Translate objectives into data mining problem definition:**

> [!note] How can we leverage X-Domain data to enhance client care, optimize resource allocation, and improve operational efficiency?

- Enhance client care: Understand how social media usage affects individuals' mental health and well-being to provide personalized support and interventions.
- Optimize resource allocation: Allocate resources effectively by identifying high-risk groups or individuals who may need additional support or intervention.
- Improve operational efficiency: Implement strategies to minimize negative effects of social media on mental health, leading to increased productivity and overall well-being.

3. **Prepare a preliminary strategy to meet objectives:**

> [!note] What analytical approaches can be employed to identify trends, patterns, and insights from X-Domain data to support decision-making?

-  Descriptive Analytics: Calculate summary statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of social media usage and psychological factors in the dataset.
- Correlation Analysis: Explore relationships between social media usage and psychological factors to identify key drivers or predictors.
- Regression Analysis: Build regression models to quantify the impact of social media usage on psychological factors while controlling for other variables.
- Cluster Analysis: Identify distinct groups or clusters of individuals based on their social media usage patterns and psychological profiles.
- Hypothesis Testing: Formulate hypotheses about the relationships between social media usage and psychological factors and conduct statistical tests to validate these hypotheses.
- Data Visualization: Create compelling visualizations to communicate findings effectively, such as scatter plots, heatmaps, or box plots, to identify trends and patterns.

# Data Understanding Phase (Points: 4 - Speech Duration: 2 Minutes):
1. **Collect data:**

> [!note] What sources of X-Domain data are available for analysis, including client records, histories, operational outcomes, and operational metrics?

2. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):**

> [!note] What insights can be gained from the initial exploration of the X-Domain dataset, and what are the KPIs (key performance indicators)?

3. **Assess data quality:**

> [!note] How can we evaluate the quality, accuracy, and completeness of X-Domain data to ensure reliable analysis and decision-making?

4. **Select interesting subsets:**

> [!note] Are there specific subsets of the X-Domain data, such as client cohorts or conditions, that warrant deeper analysis based on predefined criteria?

# Data Visualization Phase (Points: 3 - Speech Duration: 2 Minutes):

> [!note] Design and develop a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to visualize key insights and trends derived from X-Domain data, focusing onÂ **KPIs**.

# Data Preparation Phase (Points: 4 - Speech Duration: 2 Minutes):
1. **Prepares for modeling in subsequent phases:**

> [!note] How can we preprocess and clean the X-Domain data to address missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies?

2. **Select cases and variables appropriate for analysis:**

> [!note] Which variables and attributes are most relevant for understanding client outcomes, X-Domain interventions, and operational performance?

3. **Perform transformation of certain variables, if needed:**

> [!note] How can we derive new features or variables from X-Domain data to support predictive modeling, risk stratification, and decision support systems?
