# Business/Research Understanding Phase (Points: 4 - Speech Duration: 2 Minutes): 

1. **Define project requirements and objectives:**

> [!note] What are the primary objectives of this analysis in the X-Domain? How can data analytics improve decision-making processes?

- Understand household expenditure patterns across different categories.
- Identify key areas of expenditure and potential insights for optimizing financial decisions.

2. **Translate objectives into data mining problem definition:**

> [!note] How can we leverage X-Domain data to enhance client care, optimize resource allocation, and improve operational efficiency?

- Use household expenditure data to analyze spending habits and trends.
- Extract actionable insights to improve budgeting and financial planning.

1. **Prepare a preliminary strategy to meet objectives:**

> [!note] What analytical approaches can be employed to identify trends, patterns, and insights from X-Domain data to support decision-making?

Prepare a preliminary strategy to meet objectives:

- Utilize Python data analytics libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data analysis.
- Employ visualization techniques to communicate findings effectively.

# Data Understanding Phase (Points: 4 - Speech Duration: 2 Minutes):
1. **Collect data:**

> [!note] What sources of X-Domain data are available for analysis, including client records, histories, operational outcomes, and operational metrics?

- Collect data:
    - Dataset includes information on average household expenditures across various categories.
    ![[Pasted image 20240221184134.png]]
1. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):**

> [!note] What insights can be gained from the initial exploration of the X-Domain dataset, and what are the KPIs (key performance indicators)?

- Explore the distribution of expenditure across different categories.
- Identify trends and patterns in household spending.
- GEO(region),  Household expenditures, 

3. **Assess data quality:**

> [!note] How can we evaluate the quality, accuracy, and completeness of X-Domain data to ensure reliable analysis and decision-making?

- Evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the dataset.
- Handle any missing or inconsistent data points.

4. **Select interesting subsets:**

> [!note] Are there specific subsets of the X-Domain data, such as client cohorts or conditions, that warrant deeper analysis based on predefined criteria?

- Focus on specific expenditure categories that are significant or show interesting trends.
# Data Visualization Phase (Points: 3 - Speech Duration: 2 Minutes):

> [!note] Design and develop a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to visualize key insights and trends derived from X-Domain data, focusing onÂ **KPIs**.

Design and develop a comprehensive visualization:
- Create visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) to represent expenditure patterns.
- Highlight key insights such as the distribution of spending across categories and changes over time.

# Data Preparation Phase (Points: 4 - Speech Duration: 2 Minutes):
1. **Prepares for modeling in subsequent phases:**

> [!note] How can we preprocess and clean the X-Domain data to address missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies?

- Clean the dataset by addressing any missing values or outliers.
- Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly for analysis.

1. **Select cases and variables appropriate for analysis:**

> [!note] Which variables and attributes are most relevant for understanding client outcomes, X-Domain interventions, and operational performance?

- Identify relevant variables for understanding household expenditure patterns.
- Choose cases (e.g., different geographic regions) for comparative analysis.

3. **Perform transformation of certain variables, if needed:**

> [!note] How can we derive new features or variables from X-Domain data to support predictive modeling, risk stratification, and decision support systems?

- Derive additional features from the dataset to enhance analysis (e.g., calculating percentage of total expenditure for each category).
