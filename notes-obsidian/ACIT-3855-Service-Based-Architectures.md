-  ## Service #service
	- A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and can be acted upon and updated independently. This is very much like our definition of a class but with RESTful API!
	- A service typically has four properties:
		- It logically represents a business activity with a specific outcome (i.e., single responsibility) 
		- It is self-contained 
		- It is a “black-box” for its consumers 
		- It may use other underlying services
- ## Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) #soa
	- Style of software design where the software components are Services that interact through a communication protocol over a network.
