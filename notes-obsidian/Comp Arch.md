### Notes
	Things he just were important
- The Invention of Microprogramming 1940s, two levels 1950-1960s three-level machines were constructed 
- The Invention of the Operating System Early 1960s researchers at Dartmouth College, M.I.T., and elsewhere developed operating systems that allowed (multiple) programmers to communicate directly with the computer. 
- **The Migration of Functionality to Microcode 1970, adding new instructions without using hardware or in other words adding hardware (new machine instructions) by programming**
- RISC stands for ==Reduced Instruction Set Compute==

Microcontrollers typically have three types of memory on board:
- **Flash** memory is programmable using an external interface and high voltages, and this is where program code and data are stored. Flash RAM is nonvolatile, so even if the system is powered down, the flash memory will remember what was written to it. 
- **EEPROM** is also nonvolatile, but unlike flash RAM, it can be changed by the program while it is running. This is the storage in which an embedded system would keep user configuration information. 
- **RAM** is where program variables will be stored as the program runs. This memory is volatile, so any value stored here will be lost once the system loses power. EEPROM = Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory
