Assingment 2
- do question 1, 4, 2, 3
- 3 beneficial for quiz
- Log identities in assignment ??

mudle 3
- uni polar and bipolar
	- why and pros and cons
	- combining or switching the two
- return to zero schemes
- issues and solutions to solving them
- ![[Pasted image 20250523153038.png]]
- need to recognize
	- what is ASK
	- know the components
	- ![[Pasted image 20250606125401.png]]
	- baud rate etc.
	- do the same for FSK
	- and PSK
		- 180 degree phase shift for 0
- ![[Pasted image 20250606125611.png]]
- anything on +x axis is BASK
- -x and +x is BPSK
- QPSK same distance means == amplitude 
- ![[Pasted image 20250606130720.png]]
- FM most positive == high frequency 
- ![[Pasted image 20250606130941.png]]
- becoming positive == speed up, negative slow down, based on slope

- question2
	- each simple wave has a frequesncy 
	- mimunm sampling raite is 2xmax
- no vertical line connecting mismatch graphs
- ![[Pasted image 20250613140042.png]]
- coderate up so N down
  ![[Pasted image 20250613145234.png]]
	- or r should be as low as possible
	- somewhere between codewords and code rate is an optimal r
