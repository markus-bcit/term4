# Ansible Dynamic Inventory Demonstration

## Description

This configuration demonstrates how to use the AWS_EC2 Ansible dynamic inventory
plugin.

The key files are:

- `ansible.cfg`: This is the Ansible configuration file. It specifies:
  - the location of the dynamic inventory script directory: the `inventory`
    directory in the current directory.
  - the plugins to use to generate the inventory dynamically: `aws_ec2` plugin.
  - the ssh options to allow SSH connections to the EC2 instances where the host
    key changes.
- `inventory/aws_ec2.yml`: This is the dynamic inventory plugin configuration.
  It specifies how to organize the generated inventory.
- `group_vars/all.yml`: This is the group variables file. It specifies the
  default values for all the groups. In this case, it is used to specify the SSH
  user and key to connect to the EC2 instances. This is generated by Terraform
